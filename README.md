# Finance Calculators
## Description
This code is a simple calculator that allows the user to choose between two types of calculations: investment and bond.

If the user chooses investment, the code will ask for the amount of money deposited, the interest rate, the number of years invested, and the type of interest (simple or compound). The code will then calculate and display the total amount after applying the interest rate.

If the user chooses bond, the code will ask for the present value of the house, the interest rate, and the number of months to repay the bond. The code will then calculate and display the monthly repayment amount.

The code is designed to accept any valid input from the user, regardless of capitalisation, and to show an error message if the input is invalid. The code uses mathematical formulas to perform the calculations.
